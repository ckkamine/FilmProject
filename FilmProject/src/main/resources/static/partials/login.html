						<h3>The Ultimate App Store List</h3>
						<p>There&#8217;s more to app stores than Google Play for Android and Apple&#8217;s iTunes and App Store. The obvious names are the Amazon App Store and Chinese giant Baidu, but there are more alternatives still.</p>
<p>If you want to increase the reach of your app to audiences abroad, or if your idea has a specific niche audience, then you might find what you need in our big list of app stores, but don’t forget the top three – competition is fierce, but it’s important to be part of it. You can find more app distribution services and channels in our <strong><a href="http://www.businessofapps.com/user-acquisition">user acquisition directory</a></strong>.</p>
<p>From country- to platform-specific storefronts, we’ve collected a list of all the places your mobile app can be downloaded onto a device.</p>
<p>The guide is divided in the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1">Android App Stores</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Cross-platform App Stores</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">iOS App Stores</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">BlackBerry App Stores</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Manufacturer-specific App Stores</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Chinese App Stores</a></li>
<li><a href="#7">Operator and Country-Specific Stores</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We begin with the Android-specific stores.</p>
<h2>Android App Stores</h2>
<p>The freedom given to developers for the Android platform means many app stores have been created for it, with some focusing on specific niches or languages and others boasting better algorithms and app discovery engines. As of July 2015, <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/">Google Play gave Android users a choice of 1.6 million apps</a>, with Apple’s App Store a close second with 1.5 million apps – <a href="http://www.statista.com/topics/1002/mobile-app-usage/">according to this report by Statista.com</a>, over 100 billion apps have been downloaded from the latter alone.</p>
